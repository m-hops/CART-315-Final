# CART 315 Final - Youth Night
 
Final Design Documentation:

Based on previous feedback, I adjusted the lighting levels in the maze area and flashlight to help players navigate better. Unfortunately due to a design limitation with the engine, I spent my last hours with this program getting scene switching to work only to then find out I had setup the wrong pipeline for enemy AI navigation. Ultimately this project I would consider 75% successful in what I set out to accomplish in that artistically and through the various Unity systems (URP, Lighting, Particles) I accomplished establishing atmosphere. I will be spending the summer starting this project from the beginning to build my own game manager and therefore have greater control over future builds.
